Air Quality Index (AQI) is a measure of air quality that describes the level of air pollution.
Air quality has a significant impact on human health. Degradation in air quality leads to an
expansive range of health issues, especially in children. Machine learning algorithms can
help in predicting the AQI. With the help of air quality index prediction, the government and
other concerned organizations can take decisions and necessary steps to save the vulnerable, from
being exposed to toxic air. Traditional approaches to this task have very limited success
because of a lack of access to such methods to sufficient longitudinal data. In this paper, we
use Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, Lasso
Regression, and Xgboost regressor model to predict the levels of air quality index in Bangalore
city based on two datasets. The mean absolute error (MEA), mean squared error (MSA) and rootmean-square error (RMSE) were used to evaluate the performance of the regression models.
Through the analysis of the datasets and training of the regression models, we sought to
identify the most effective approach for air quality index prediction. By comparing the
performance of the different models, we aimed to determine which model yielded the most
accurate predictions and could potentially be employed for future air quality assessments.
The results obtained from this project contribute to the field of air quality monitoring and
prediction, providing valuable insights for policymakers, environmental organizations, and
the general public. With accurate predictions of air quality index levels, proactive measures
can be taken to mitigate pollution and safeguard the health and well-being of the residents in
Bangalore city and beyond.
Overall, this project serves as a foundation for further research and applications in the field of
air quality assessment, facilitating better decision-making processes and fostering sustainable
development in urban environments.
